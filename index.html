            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Charlie is a full stack web developer with a certification from UNC Charlotte's Coding Bootcamp. Coming from a background
                in art and illustration (with their MA in Illustration from SCAD), Charlie combines their love of learning and thirst for 
                challenge with their skill in creativity. Charlie offers a unique perspective when working with web designers, knowing that
                it can be just as important to nail down those little details as it is to have a creative design work comprehensively as a whole.
